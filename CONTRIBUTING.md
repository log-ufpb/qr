# Contributing

You don’t necessarily have to make direct changes to the code, sometimes just reaching out to the collaborators and sharing something that could be added is already a valuable contribution.

However, if you’d like to contribute add new content, please follow the steps below:


### 1. Install [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)

Follow this [installation guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/guide/installation.html) to set it up.

> **Note:** It’s recommended to learn the basics of writing and structuring an mdBook before contributing. Take a look at the [official documentation](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to get familiar with it.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:log-ufpb/qr.git
```

### 3. Create a new branch

Create a new branch with a descriptive name that reflects the content or feature you’re adding.
For example: `instance-generation`, `math-classes`.

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```


### 4. Add new content

Adding new content is straightforward, just follow the structure and conventions already used in the project.


### 5. Commit and push your changes

Once you’ve added your content, commit your changes and push the branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add content for <branch-name>"
git push origin <branch-name>
```


### 6. Create a Pull Request

Open a Pull Request (PR) to propose your changes. Follow this [GitHub tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) if you’re not familiar with the process.
