# Decision Point

A decision point \\(k \in \\{0,...,K\\}\\)  marks a moment within the planning horizon \\(\mathcal{T} = \\{0,...,T\\}\\) when a decision must be made. Each decision point is triggered by a system event and can be associated with a system time \\(t_k \in \mathcal{T}\\).

## Examples of system events

### Dynamic routing

In routing, it is common to make a decision after the arrival of a new request \\(r_k\\). Some papers consider the arrival of a vehicle in a location, or even both.
