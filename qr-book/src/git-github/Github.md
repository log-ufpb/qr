## Authentication

On some platforms like GitLab, one can easily sign in to their account through Git CLI by using a username and password. However, GitHub does not allow you to do that. Instead, you have to set up a [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) that will be used to identify you when doing operations like pushing content to a remote repository.
