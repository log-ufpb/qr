# Quick Reference
By *LOG-UFPB*.

Welcome to **Quick Reference**, a collection of useful knowledge that can be accessed quickly.

The effort of one person to understand how to solve a problem should be recorded so that others in the same situation only need to consult the QR instead of going through the same struggle.
Besides, random knowledge such as links (to videos or websites), libraries, tips, and tricks can be useful to many people but are not always intuitive to find or use. Therefore, documenting them is important.

Here, you will find quick references related to the topics below and more:

- Programming
- Optimization
- Mathematics
- Data science

The QR is Markdown-based book created with [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/), just like [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and [Helix Documentation](https://docs.helix-editor.com/).
