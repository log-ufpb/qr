# Submitting a paper to an Elsevier journal

## New submissions

In a new submission the manuscript can be uploaded as a single PDF file or Word document. Additional source files are not mandatory, but can be provided at the initial submission. It's important to note that individual figure files larger than 10 MB must be uploaded separately.

## Revised submissions

An editable version of the manuscript must be provided for the review stage. In case of submission in LaTeX, the Elsevier article class must be used.
```latex
\documentclass[preprint,review,12pt]{elsarticle}
```

To ensure that the Elsevier system processes references correctly, you should use the BibTeX bibliography style **elsarticle-harv** available [`here`](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/elsarticle).

After including `elsarticle-harv.bst` in your project, change the bibliography style in your `.tex` file:
```latex
\bibliographystyle{elsarticle-harv}\biboptions{authoryear}
```

During the submission process, you will need to upload the following files of the manuscript:
   - The `.tex` file of your manuscript.
   - The `.bib` file containing your references.
   - The `.bbl` file generated by BibTeX.

Additionally, be prepared to upload any other documents or files requested by the journal as part of the submission process (e.g. Highlights, Comments to reviewers, Cover letter).

These steps will help ensure that your revised manuscript is correctly formatted and processed by the Elsevier journal's submission system.
